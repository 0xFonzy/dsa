# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Problem with Coding Interview Prep

Coding interview prep courses and platforms like Leetcode often provide only a limited overview of data structures and algorithm patterns, leaving gaps in knowledge when encountering unfamiliar problems.  
They typically cover only a few patterns per data structure and expect developers to identify patterns independently through practice.  
Previously, it was challenging to find a comprehensive list of these patterns online.  
This repository uses ChatGPT to offer a complete list of essential algorithms for coding interviews.
